The purpose of this project was to attempt to combine my financial knowledge with my programming knowledge. I wanted to see if I could automate the creation of a DCF model
(discounted cash flow), and along the way I was teaching myself how to use pandas and Numpy. 

This project has been a great learning experience for somebody who is just learning how to properly program, and I will continue to work on this project to fix bugs and optimize it as a whole.
